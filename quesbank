What are the advantages of Bootstrap?

Features that adapt to phones, tablets, and desktops: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adapts to phones, tablets, and desktops.
A mobile-first strategy: Mobile-first styles are built into the Bootstrap framework.
Bootstrap 4 is compatible with all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, Safari, and Opera

What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?

A bootstrap container is a handy class that generates a central region on the page where we can put our site content. The bootstrap .container has the advantage of being responsive and containing all of our other HTML code. Containers are used to pad the content within them, and there are two types of containers:

The .container class creates a fixed-width container that is responsive.
The .container-fluid class creates a full-width container that spans the entire viewport width

What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?

There are five classes in the Bootstrap 4 grid system:

.col- for extra small devices, whose screen width is less than 576px.
.col-sm- small devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 576px.
.col-md- medium devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 768px.
.col-lg- large devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 992px.
.col-xl- extra large devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 1200px.
The classes listed above can be combined to build layouts that are more dynamic and adaptable

----------------------------------

What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5

Grid System 	     5 tier grid system(xs, sm, md, lg, xl).	6 tier grid system(xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl).
Color	             It has limited colors.	Extra colors have been added with the looks.
Jquery	           It has jQuery along with all the related plugins.	Jquery is removed and it has switched to vanilla JS with some working plugins.
Internet Explorer	 Bootstrap 4 supports both IE 10 and 11.	Bootstrap 5 doesn’t support IE 10 and 11.
Form elements	     Radio buttons and checkboxes look different in different OS and browsers.	The look of form elements does not change on different OS or browsers.

What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?

Multiple buttons can be placed together on a single line using button groups. You can use this to group objects together, such as alignment buttons.

The .btn-group class is used for basic button groups. You can use the class .btn to wrap a set of buttons in .btn-group.

In Bootstrap, what are the two codes for displaying code?

The <code> element is used to showcase a piece of inline code.
You can use the <pre> tag to display a code that has multiple lines or even a block element.

How can one create an alert in Bootstrap?

Create a wrapper <div> and add a class of .alert and one of the contextual classes to create a basic alert (e.g., .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning, .alert-danger, .alert-primary, .alert-secondary, .alert-light or .alert-dark).

A basic Bootstrap 4 table features horizontal divisions and light padding.
The .table class gives a table some basic styling.
The .table-striped class gives zebra stripes to the table.
The .table-bordered class adds borders to the table and cells on all sides.
On table rows, the .table-hover class adds a hover effect (grey background color).

Write the HTML code to create a basic toast.

When something happens, the toast component acts as an alert box that only appears for a few seconds (i.e. when the user clicks on a button, submits a form, etc.).
<div class= "toast" >
 <div class= "toast-header" >
   Toast Header
 </div>
 <div class="toast-body">
   Toast Body Text
 </div>
</div>

What is bootstrap pagination and how are they classified?

<ul class="pagination">
   <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">Previous</a></li>
   <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">1</a></li>
   <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">2</a></li>
   <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">3</a></li>
   <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">4</a></li>
   <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">Next</a></li>

 Pagination is how Bootstrap handles an unordered list. The following classes are provided by bootstrap to manage pagination:

.pagination: This class is required to enable pagination on your page.

.disabled, .active: Use .disabled for unclickable links and .active to indicate the current page when customising links.

.pagination-Ig and .pagination-sm: use these to get different size items.
